# bfcompiler

### What the f**k is it?

bfcompiler is a just-in-time (JIT) compiler for the esoteric programming language, Brainfuck.
This project was created as a learning project with the goal of learning about compilers and the x86_64 instruction set, hence why the code is so comically overengineered.

### What the f**k can it do?

Currently, the compiler is able to generate machine code for all Brainfuck instructions except for getchar.
